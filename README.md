## Alphabet Soup Charity Funding Predictor ##
# Overview #

This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to predict the success of funding applications submitted to Alphabet Soup, a philanthropic organization. By analyzing historical data on various applications and their outcomes, the project seeks to identify patterns that can help predict which future applications will be successful, thereby assisting Alphabet Soup in allocating resources more effectively.

# Data Preprocessing #
The dataset includes features such as APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT, alongside the target variable IS_SUCCESSFUL, which indicates the effectiveness of the fund usage.

# Preprocessing Steps #
Target Variable: IS_SUCCESSFUL serves as the target, indicating the success of the funding application.
Features: The aforementioned variables, excluding identifiers, are used as features.
Exclusions: Identifiers like EIN and NAME were removed as they do not contribute to the predictive model.

# Model Design and Evaluation #
The neural network model features two hidden layers with 90 and 40 neurons, respectively, employing relu activations for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer. This architecture was chosen for its balance between complexity and efficiency, aiming to exceed a predictive accuracy of 75%.

# Optimization Efforts #
Adjusting layer depths and neuron counts.
Exploring different activation functions.
Refining training durations and preprocessing techniques.
# Results Summary #

The model's performance, including whether the target accuracy was achieved and the challenges encountered, is documented here. Despite extensive optimization, achieving consistent performance above the 75% accuracy threshold proved challenging due to factors such as overfitting and the complexity of the dataset.

# Alternative Approaches #
Considering the limitations faced by the neural network model, a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) approach, utilizing frameworks like XGBoost or LightGBM, is recommended for future exploration due to its robustness, efficiency, and interpretability, particularly for tabular data.

# Conclusion #
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning to philanthropic funding prediction, highlighting both the potential and the challenges of this approach. The exploration of alternative models like GBM offers a promising direction for improving predictive performance and gaining insights into the factors influencing funding success.
